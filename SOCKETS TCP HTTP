My socket notes:
--------------------- >

TCP :

@)  What is a TCP Connection?
..> TCP = Transmission Control Protocol
..> It is the base layer protocol used for reliable communication over the internet.
..> When two devices communicate, TCP creates a persistent connection using a handshake:
🔸 3-step handshake
Client → Server: SYN
Server → Client: SYN + ACK
Client → Server: ACK

Key Features of TCP
---------------------------- >
[[ Reliable (guarantees delivery)
Ordered (packets arrive in order)
Connection-oriented (long-lived)
Error recovery
Flow control  ]]
🔸 TCP = long, continuous connection
Once opened, client & server can keep sending data continuously without re-opening connection every time.

Key Features of HTTP
----------------------------> 
.> HTTP runs on top of TCP, but works differently:
.> HTTP = stateless, Each request is independent.
.> Client must initiate every communication
.> 🔸 Steps every time
Client opens a TCP connection
Sends HTTP request
Server sends response
TCP connection closes (mostly)











1. What Is Real-Time Communication?
..> Real-time communication means data is delivered instantly between client and server without delay.
Used in: chat apps, live dashboards, gaming, notifications, streaming.

2️. Different Techniques for Real-Time Communication ?
..> Polling 
Client repeatedly asks server:
“Do you have new data?”

 How it works: Browser sends an HTTP GET request every X seconds.
Server responds with latest data.

Advantages: [ Very simple, Works everywhere. ]
Disadvantages: [ High network usage, Delayed updates, Not real-time. ]

B) Short Polling

Same as polling but shorter intervals (e.g., every 1 second).
 Pros: Slightly faster updates.
 Cons: [ More server load, Still not true real-time. ]

C) Long Polling [ A better version of polling. ]

D) Server-Sent Events (SSE): [
One-way real-time connection from server → client.
[  Works over HTTP, Server continuously pushes updates., Client cannot send data back through SSE. ]

E) sockets : [ One persistent TCP connection, Bi-directional ]
cons: Cannot be cached, Requires WebSocket-enabled infrastructure.


Points: 
.> Socket.IO is a library built on top of WebSockets.
.> People often think Socket.IO is the same as WebSocket, but this is wrong.

What Happens When You Refresh the Browser in Socket.IO :


1. The Socket connection is destroyed

..> The browser closes the old WebSocket connection.
..> A new WebSocket connection is immediately created.
..> The server treats you as a NEW client (new socket.id).
..> and we are disconnected from the your rooms.

Note :== >
Sockets.io internally uses, WebSocket (preferred transport), This gives true real-time, full-duplex communication.
But, If WebSocket cannot be used (due to firewall, proxy, browser, network restriction),
Socket.IO falls back to long-polling.  which menas here 
Long polling = client sends request → server responds → new request → repeat.

Difference between the sockets and web_sockets:

TIP :- 
WebSocket = one tool
Socket.IO = toolkit
The toolkit prefers using the best tool (WebSocket).
But if that tool is blocked, it uses a backup tool (long-polling) to keep things working.

“WebSocket = protocol.
Socket.IO = framework built on top of WebSocket + fallback.”


✔️ Socket.IO Features : 
--------------------------------- > 
Auto reconnect
Heartbeats / ping-pong
Event-based communication (socket.emit, socket.on)
Rooms & namespaces
Binary data support
Built-in fallback to long-polling
Works even behind strict firewalls or proxies
