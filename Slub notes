ABOUT THE SLUB IN DETAILLY HERE:

..> What is a Slug in a URL?
A slug is the readable part of a URL, usually at the end of the path, that identifies a specifi
c page or resource in a website.

https://myblog.com/posts/how-to-learn-javascript
In this example, the slug is: how-to-learn-javascript
It usually represents the title or name of the page content.


You can use libraries like:
=============================== >

npm install slugify

const slugify = require("slugify");
const title = "10 Tips for Full-Stack Developers";
const slug = slugify(title, { lower: true }); // "10-tips-for-full-stack-developers"
ðŸ”¹ Where You See Slugs Commonly
Blogs: /posts/my-first-blog

E-commerce sites: /products/iphone-14-pro
YouTube: /watch?v=abc123 (not a slug, just an ID)
Custom portfolios: /projects/chat-app-using-react


..> we need the slug because :

In big projects, slugs make URLs clean, meaningful, and SEO-friendly, which improves user experience and discoverability.

 Why We Use Slugs in Big Projects:
Problem Without Slugs	How Slugs Help
URLs look like site.com/post/92837 â€“ not readable	Slugs give site.com/post/learn-react-basics â€“ easy to read
Users canâ€™t guess what the page is	Slugs describe the content directly
Search engines rank your page lower	Slugs with keywords improve SEO
URLs are hard to remember/share	Slugs make sharing simple and meaningful
Developer routing is less clear	Slugs help in clean routing logic like /:slug
