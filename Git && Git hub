git : it is an application/software and it is an distributed version control system

..> GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code


>git config --global --list {to see the configuration 
user.email=sachinreddy91619@gmail.com
user.name=Sachin reddy

..> git config --global user.name "sachn"
..> git config --global user.email "sachin@gmail.com".



working directory :

git init { for intializay=tion of the git}

git add { to move the file from the WD to the staging area/index }

STaging Area/ :
 
git commit { to the files from the SA to the Local Repository. }

till this code all the code changes will be final and it will be saved after this command.

LOCal Repository :

HERE WD, SA, LR : All stages are the local in the system only.

git push { to move the files to the cloud database in to the repository.
  


scenario:
we have the project folder in the GitHub: to work on it i need to get the folder in to the local so for that i need to use:

git clone

after working on it : to push in the GitHub:

git add
git commit
git push

git status { to see the get files status  


..>  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 demogit.txt,

here  1 insertion(+)
 this line indicates that we have changed one line in the project folder  here, 


....> Add one branch for the one features when working in the project:

.> git log { for seeing how many commits happened and what happened in the  how has done it we use the , see commits,  and commit messages,  git commit id for usages: }

.> git add . { used to add all the files.
 
....>


scenario:
--------------->
I a have  project folder in the in my local i need to post it in the GitHub/cloud for that

for first time :

git init
git add .

git commit -m "This is my commiting"

git remote add origin https://github.com/sachinreddy91619/demogit11.git

{ here the "origin"it can be any thing nay name. it represents the URL

{ when ever we use the origin it indicates the URL

{ By this command just it will link to the remote  repository.

git push -u origin main




.> git branch { it is used to see the current branch


git push -u origin main{ here -u represents that "origin main" is common for every time you  do next time push in github


scenario:

we have a project folder in the github repository in the cloud i we to work on that complete project :

to get the files in to the local :
open GitHub repo { in cloud we have an option called <CODE> click on it and we get the options to choose for the GitHub clone:
https: select the link:

git clone URL



.....> 

after cloning the project every developer will add new features to the project and we need to get the updated code in to the folder we use:

git pull 

but iam getting this  error :
$ git pull
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master

I need to use this:

..> so use : git pull origin <branch>

-------------------------------------------------------->
gitignore

..> the files in the gitignore will not be tracked here.

..>the files which are not need to send in to the git hub remote repository  that need to kept in the gitignore:

like :
log files
API keys/credential file
libraries/dependencies
.env

..>Ignore specific files { credentials.txt , .env }

..>Ignores files with some extension { ".txt",.mp4..

..> Igonre specific folder ex: temp/,/nodemodule,

ig: /node_modules only ignores the first folder from where our git initialized , 
if these folders are in the sub folders to ignore them  we need to give /postfix of the folder name. , node_modules/

..> if we donot want to send the .txt files at all then we need to give it in the gitignore has
*.git

..> but we need all .txt files to be ignored but i need sachin.txt to skip the ignore then we need to give it has
!text.txt

How To go to Previous Version of code:

to get the commit id :

git log { shows large code

git log --oneline { to get the compressed hash code we this command.


git checkout <commit-id> { to move into that particular id we use this command }

you will move in to the id branch : to see the content at this place use: cat <filename>

..> to move out of that id : use the "git checkout master"

exit { to move out of the git bash and close git bash }


======================================>======================================>======================================>


GIT REVERT :

.> It is used to undo changes introduced by a specific commit while preserving the commit history.

sy:

git revert commit id

git revert HEAD



HEAD ===resent commit id or last commit id

head~1 === penultimate commit it (last-1)


..> When you use git revert <commit-id>, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.

..> this new commit only affects your local repository. It doesn't automatically update the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

..> You need to push the changes to the remote repository for it to reflect the changes made by git revert.

.> git revert <commit-id>
.> git push

GIT RESET:

.> It is used to move the HEAD POinter to a specific commit, it modifies the commit history by adjusting the HEAD Pointer.

git reset commit id

after this command the commits after the <given commit ids > will be deleted.

.> git reset HEAD~NUMBER {ALSO WORKS } 


.> git reset <commit-Id> { the commit history will be delete but the filesare in the staging area}

git add .
git commit -m



.> git reset --soft commit id 

{by this commit the COMMITS after this commits will be deleted but the the code will be present in the staging Area.
git commit -m "message"

.>git reset -- hard commit id

{ by this commit the COMMITS after this commits will be deleted , files completly delete the files even from the staging area.}

.> git branch {To see the list of branches }

.> git branch <branch_name> { To create a new branch }

git checkout <branch_name> { switches working to the specified branch}}


git checkout -b <bracnh_name> { to  create new and shift to that branch}




git merge <branch_name> { To merge a branch with other branch }

ex: git merge dev



:> In order to merge the code , to which branch we need to merge , for that we need to be in that Branch.

;> generally after we are creating the a sub branch from main branch, if we try to delete a that sub branch without completely merging into the master branch then we get the ERROR.


git branch -d <branc/,;


...> * indicated that on which branch you are in

...> A merge conflict happens when Git tries to merge changes from two branches, but can't automatically determine which changes to keep. 

...> This usually occurs when the same lines in a file have been changed in different branches.


...> To come out of the merge conflict and return to a clean state:
If you want to abort the merge and discard the current merge attempt:

...> git merge --abort

===============================================> =========================================>
===============================================> =========================================>

MERGE CONFLICTS :
--------------------->

..> If one branch renames or moves a file while another branch modifies it



..> if a file deleted in one branch and modifies in another branch then we get the conflicts.

===============================================> =========================================>
===============================================> =========================================>

PUll request:

..> pull request is used to merge branches in remote repository.


It is used when:

scenario-1:
If we have the two or more branches in the same repository , then too merge them we use the
PULL REQUEST

scenario-2:
merging branches in forked repository to original repository.

Git hub details :
.> Your commit username & email come ONLY from git config — not from Windows Credential Manager.


 # This is what decides the “author” shown on GitHub:
.> git config --global user.name
.> git config --global user.email

# If your company wants it different, you change it like this:
.> git config --global user.name "K. Sachin Reddy"
.> git config --global user.email "your.company@email.com"

# To see the list of the usee details: 
.> git config --global --list

# To intialize the git hub :
.> git init

# To check the status:
.> git status

# Now commit:
git commit -m "Initial commit - added new folder"


# To move in to new branch :
.> git checkout main
.> git pull origin main

# To create new branch from main => Development:
.> git checkout -b development
.>git push -u origin development

# To create a new branch from the develpoment , and create loginAPI.
.> git checkout development
.> git checkout -b loginAPI-module
.> git push -u origin loginAPI-module

# To see the full tree graph:
.> git log --oneline  --decorate  -- graph --all

# To see the more git commands :
.> git --help
.> git --version

# To get the latestv code in to the the bracn then we use this :
.> git pull origin <branch-Name>

Commands related to the staging:
---------------------------------------- >
# To move data in to the stashing:
..>  git stash push -m "messages"
# To see the code changes from the stashing:
.>  git stash list:
# To apply those changes to the stashing:
.>  git stash apply
# To remove the changes from the stashing:
.>  git stash pop


# To check out to a specific commit :
.> git checkout < commit-hash >

Understanding the “commit tree” :
-------------------------------------------- >

# The commit tree is a chronological view of all commits in a branch, showing:
# Commit hash / ID – unique identifier for a commit.
# Author and date – who made the commit and when.
# Commit message – what changes were made.
 # Branches / merges – shows branching structure.



Step's to use the SSH in the GitHub :
-------------------------------------------- >

# what is the ? 
.> SSH keys are a pair of cryptographic keys used for secure authentication between my
    computer and remote servers like GitHub. The public key is stored on GitHub and the private key 
    stays on my local machine. When I push or pull code, GitHub verifies my identity using key-based 
    authentication instead of passwords, which is more secure and faster.

# SSH = Secure Shell
.> SSH keys are like a super-secure digital identity card for your laptop.
.> If i use the ssh kesy then i will not require the No, password required.

Over via of the  ssh working:
------------------------------------ >
Let’s simulate a git push
git push

.> Your laptop looks for your private SSH key
.> It sends a mathematical proof to GitHub
.> GitHub checks it against the public key stored in your account
.> If it matches → ✅ Access allowed
.> Not ONE TIME does your password travel.
 
Types of SSH keys:
..................................................................... >
RSA 
ED25519


ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ksbussiness123@gmail.com"


After copying:

Go to GitHub
Click profile → Settings
Click SSH and GPG Keys
Click New SSH key
Paste the key
Save it

ssh -T git@github.com
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
