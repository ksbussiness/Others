'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some

git : it is an application/software and it is an distributed version control system

..> GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code


>git config --global --list {to see the configuration 
user.email=sachinreddy91619@gmail.com
user.name=Sachin reddy

..> git config --global user.name "sachn"
..> git config --global user.email "sachin@gmail.com".



working directory :

git init { for intializay=tion of the git}

git add { to move the file from the WD to the staging area/index }

STaging Area/ :
 
git commit { to the files from the SA to the Local Repository. }

till this code all the code changes will be final and it will be saved after this command.

LOCal Repository :

HERE WD, SA, LR : All stages are the local in the system only.

git push { to move the files to the cloud database in to the repository.
  


scenario:
we have the project folder in the GitHub: to work on it i need to get the folder in to the local so for that i need to use:

git clone

after working on it : to push in the GitHub:

git add
git commit
git push

git status { to see the get files status  


..>  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 demogit.txt,

here  1 insertion(+)
 this line indicates that we have changed one line in the project folder  here, 


....> Add one branch for the one features when working in the project:

.> git log { for seeing how many commits happened and what happened in the  how has done it we use the , see commits,  and commit messages,  git commit id for usages: }

.> git add . { used to add all the files.
 
....>


scenario:
--------------->
I a have  project folder in the in my local i need to post it in the GitHub/cloud for that

for first time :

git init
git add .

git commit -m "This is my commiting"

git remote add origin https://github.com/sachinreddy91619/demogit11.git

{ here the "origin"it can be any thing nay name. it represents the URL

{ when ever we use the origin it indicates the URL

{ By this command just it will link to the remote  repository.

git push -u origin main




.> git branch { it is used to see the current branch


git push -u origin main{ here -u represents that "origin main" is common for every time you  do next time push in github


scenario:

we have a project folder in the github repository in the cloud i we to work on that complete project :

to get the files in to the local :
open GitHub repo { in cloud we have an option called <CODE> click on it and we get the options to choose for the GitHub clone:
https: select the link:

git clone URL



.....> 

after cloning the project every developer will add new features to the project and we need to get the updated code in to the folder we use:

git pull 

but iam getting this  error :
$ git pull
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master

I need to use this:

..> so use : git pull origin <branch>

-------------------------------------------------------->
gitignore

..> the files in the gitignore will not be tracked here.

..>the files which are not need to send in to the git hub remote repository  that need to kept in the gitignore:

like :
log files
API keys/credential file
libraries/dependencies
.env

..>Ignore specific files { credentials.txt , .env }

..>Ignores files with some extension { ".txt",.mp4..

..> Igonre specific folder ex: temp/,/nodemodule,

ig: /node_modules only ignores the first folder from where our git initialized , 
if these folders are in the sub folders to ignore them  we need to give /postfix of the folder name. , node_modules/

..> if we donot want to send the .txt files at all then we need to give it in the gitignore has
*.git

..> but we need all .txt files to be ignored but i need sachin.txt to skip the ignore then we need to give it has
!text.txt

How To go to Previous Version of code:

to get the commit id :

git log { shows large code

git log --oneline { to get the compressed hash code we this command.


git checkout <commit-id> { to move into that particular id we use this command }

you will move in to the id branch : to see the content at this place use: cat <filename>

..> to move out of that id : use the "git checkout master"

exit { to move out of the git bash and close git bash }


======================================>======================================>======================================>


GIT REVERT :

.> It is used to undo changes introduced by a specific commit while preserving the commit history.

sy:

git revert commit id

git revert HEAD



HEAD ===resent commit id or last commit id

head~1 === penultimate commit it (last-1)


..> When you use git revert <commit-id>, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.

..> this new commit only affects your local repository. It doesn't automatically update the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

..> You need to push the changes to the remote repository for it to reflect the changes made by git revert.

.> git revert <commit-id>
.> git push

GIT RESET:

.> It is used to move the HEAD POinter to a specific commit, it modifies the commit history by adjusting the HEAD Pointer.

git reset commit id

after this command the commits after the <given commit ids > will be deleted.

.> git reset HEAD~NUMBER {ALSO WORKS } 


.> git reset <commit-Id> { the commit history will be delete but the filesare in the staging area}

git add .
git commit -m



.> git reset --soft commit id 

{by this commit the COMMITS after this commits will be deleted but the the code will be present in the staging Area.
git commit -m "message"

.>git reset -- hard commit id

{ by this commit the COMMITS after this commits will be deleted , files completly delete the files even from the staging area.}

.> git branch {To see the list of branches }

.> git branch <branch_name> { To create a new branch }

git checkout <branch_name> { switches working to the specified branch}}


git checkout -b <bracnh_name> { to  create new and shift to that branch}




git merge <branch_name> { To merge a branch with other branch }

ex: git merge dev



:> In order to merge the code , to which branch we need to merge , for that we need to be in that Branch.

;> generally after we are creating the a sub branch from main branch, if we try to delete a that sub branch without completely merging into the master branch then we get the ERROR.


git branch -d <branc/,;


...> * indicated that on which branch you are in

...> A merge conflict happens when Git tries to merge changes from two branches, but can't automatically determine which changes to keep. 

...> This usually occurs when the same lines in a file have been changed in different branches.


...> To come out of the merge conflict and return to a clean state:
If you want to abort the merge and discard the current merge attempt:

...> git merge --abort

===============================================> =========================================>
===============================================> =========================================>

MERGE CONFLICTS :
--------------------->

..> If one branch renames or moves a file while another branch modifies it



..> if a file deleted in one branch and modifies in another branch then we get the conflicts.

git rebase:


===============================================> =========================================>
===============================================> =========================================>
===============================================> =========================================>

PUll request:

..> pull request is used to merge branches in remote repository.


It is used when:

scenario-1:
If we have the two or more branches in the same repository , then too merge them we use the
PULL REQUEST

scenario-2:
merging branches in forked repository to original repository.
